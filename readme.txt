VERSION NOTES:
*"Loss of motor control" still needs planned features
*Text-based meditations could become nicer images
*Finer styling could be brought in

TITLE OF PROJECT: Worry Aggravator

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Creating a "for entertainment purposes" demonstration of frontend JavaScript

EXPLANATION OF PROJECT: I need to practice and demonstrate frontend JavaScript. Coding some stupid basic app wasn't going to challenge me. Creating a "for entertainment purposes" website will give me both problems to solve and motivation to solve them.

In this project, pay careful attention to documentation and comments. This application is going to be a like a haunted house: technology to achieve effects but designed to give a dubious user experience. If you want a good user experience, don't use something literally named "THING THAT MAKES YOUR WORRIES EVEN WORSE."

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
*HTML
*CSS
*Bootstrap 5.2.0
*JavaScript (focusing on more modern standards, will not be backward compatible with IE browsers)

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
HTML and CSS styling details will be handled by: Bootstrap 5.2.0
Interactivity will be handled with vanilla JavaScript
